Classes vs Structs

• Classes have inheritance, Structs do not
• Classes live in the heap and have pointers pointing to them
• Structs do not live in the heap, and are passed around by copying them
• Structs automatically get an initializer that will initialize all uninitialized vars
• With structs, you must mark methods "mutating" to let it know that value can change
• The swift version of a hash table is a dictionary
• Closures are functions embedded right in a line of code
